Things to do:

- [x] Remember position of the window (and screen) from last time, as a distance from the closest corner of the screen
- [x] Store camera source in UserDefaults
- [x] Fallback to next available camera is preferred is not available (but don't save it in defaults)
- [ ] Add system-wide keyboard shortcut for switching between fullscreen and medallion mode
- [ ] Add animation on transition between fullscreen and medallion mode
- [ ] Generate an icon and fill in the app metadata
- [ ] React to new camera being plugged in (make it available in sources) or removed (switch to another camera)
